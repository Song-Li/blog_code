This is the idea and the time line from Feb25-Feb28
<!--more-->
## Feb25 ##
[How GPUs Work](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~gfx/papers/pdfs/59_HowThingsWork.pdf)
[The Web Never Forgets](https://securehomes.esat.kuleuven.be/~gacar/persistent/the_web_never_forgets.pdf)
[Pixel Perfect](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~hovav/dist/canvas.pdf)
Mainly 1, setup the OpenGl environment; 2, reading somepapers. There is something new:
### New hints ###
- May use self-defined webfonts test the Graph card and drivers
- What is ISO standard 12233? It should be a lens resolution measurement way
- Try to use other characters such as Chinese, Japniese and so on to get a higher entorpy
- What is Unicode U+1F603? Can this be used as a feature
- So many paper have used the "default font" as a feature



### Graphic card ###

In the world of graphic card, everything is made of triangles. The deveopers uses graphics library (OpenGL, DriectX) to provide each triangle to the graphics pipeline one vertex at a time. After that, the graphic card will do something:
- Model transformations (by homogeneous coordinates)
- Lighting, handles multiple lights by summing the contributions of each individual light
- Camera simulation, use matrix-vector multiplication
- Rasterization
- Texturing
- Hidden surfaces
